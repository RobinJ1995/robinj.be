		<p>Custom home screen replacement for Android with themes resembling various Linux
			distributions as well as a search feature with support for several (internal and
			external) search sources.</p>
		<p>This is a spare-time project I started when I was in high school, which I am still
			working on based on feedback users leave on the Google Play Store, or on the Github
			repository. The codebase has however seen a couple of rewrites in the meantime.</p>

		<p>One of those projects that started out as a throwaway experiment to play with some
			different technologies, and happened to turn into something useful.</p>
		<p><em>"How do these new React Hooks work?"</em> turned into <em>"Let's hook this up to an
			API and a database... I wonder what MongoDB is like?"</em> and quickly became a full
			Kubernetes cluster with each component of the application running in Docker containers
			that are replicated/load balanced across 2 nodes.</p>
